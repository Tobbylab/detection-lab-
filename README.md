# detection-lab

## Objective 

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was ingest and analyse logs within a security Information and Event managment (SIEM) systems , generating test telemetry to mimic a real-world attack scenarios.This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security , attack patterns and defensive strategies .

#### Skills learned 

-Advanced understanding of SIEMS concepts and practical application.

-Proficieny in analyzing and interpreting network logs.

-Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.

-Enhanced Knowlegde of networks protocols and security vulnerabilities.

-Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity

#### Tools 

-Security information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis

-Network analysis tools (such as wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic

-Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios

#### Steps 

My first task involved configuring and installing a virtual machine.
